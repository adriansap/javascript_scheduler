Javascript Scheduler written by Adrian Saporta

This is a 9am to 5pm javascript-built scheduler. The app uses
moment.js to source time information. By sourcing this information,
the app color-coats grey for past time, red for current time and green 
for future time. 

Information is inputed by user and stored using web local storage. The
information inputed is retrieved automatically and it appears in the
input field upon web page loading.
